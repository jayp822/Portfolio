# More About Me

## Beginnings

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my coding journey. I came to coding later in life, after a period of exploration where I wasn’t quite sure what career path to follow. Initially, I considered medicine, but realized it wasn’t for me—especially the thought of working with blood and surgery.

It was during my senior year of high school that I discovered programming, thanks to my cousins in Canada who shared their enthusiasm for it. Hearing how computer science offered both creativity and variety, unlike repetitive tasks in some other fields, I became intrigued. The idea of being able to build any software I could imagine won me over completely.

Now, I’m passionate about exploring new technologies and pushing my skills through challenging projects. I actually enjoy the problem-solving and perseverance required to tackle coding roadblocks. For me, that’s where the real thinking begins.
